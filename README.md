This program was built using MATLAB R2017b and MATLAB R2018a, and employs the Image Processing Toolbox and Computer Vision Toolbox.

**Purpose of project task:** Morphological feature extraction of segmented or annotated organs in radiological volumes (scans).

**Purpose of program code for project task:** (1) Compute organ volume (volume); (2) Compute organ global curvature (meanCurv); (3) save to a MAT file: 3D rendered organ volume data, smoothed rendered 3D organ data, and values of volume and curvature; (4) save to a NIFTY file: 3D rendered organ volume data; (5) save volume (volume) and curvature (meanCurv) results of each 3D rendered organ to a .xlsx file.

To execute the program, modify and run "VolumeCurvatureReconstruction.m".
