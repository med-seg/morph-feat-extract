This program was built using MATLAB R2017b and MATLAB R2018a, and employs the Image Processing Toolbox and Computer Vision Toolbox.

**Purpose of project task:** 

Morphological feature extraction of segmented or annotated organs in radiological volumes (scans).

**Purpose of program code for project task:** 

(1) Compute organ volume (volume);

(2) Compute organ global curvature (meanCurv); 

(3) save to a MAT file: 3D rendered organ volume data (dataInterp), smoothed rendered 3D organ data (dataFilt), principal curvatures and directions (curvData), and values of volume (volume) and global curvature (meanCurv);

(4) save to a NIFTY file: 3D rendered organ volume data (dataFiltBin); 

(5) save volume (volume) and curvature (meanCurv) results of each 3D rendered organ to a .xlsx file.

**To execute the program, modify and run "VolumeCurvatureReconstruction.m".**
